# 📘 Discrete Mathematics Self-Study (Based on MIT 6.042J)

Welcome to my self-study repository for **Discrete Mathematics**, modeled on the MIT 6.042J course (Fall 2005).  
This project is designed to mirror a full-semester university course, including lectures, problem sets, reading comments, and personal reflections — all completed independently and deeply.

---

## 📌 Overview

- **Course Title**: Mathematics for Computer Science (MIT 6.042J)
- **Study Period**: July–August 2025
- **Format**: Lecture note study + problem sets + weekly summaries
- **Language**: All notes and reflections written in English
- **Goal**: To build a rigorous mathematical foundation for future studies in computer science, data analysis, and medical AI research.

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

- Use **logical reasoning** and **mathematical proofs**
- Define and analyze **sets**, **functions**, and **relations**
- Apply **induction**, **recurrence relations**, and **counting principles**
- Understand and work with **graphs**, **modular arithmetic**, and **state machines**
- Apply **discrete probability** to simple random processes
- Build the foundation needed for future work in **algorithms**, **theory of computation**, and **machine learning**
