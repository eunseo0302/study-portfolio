## üîπ Problem 1: The Pulverizer üê∏

### üß© Problem Summary

A frog sits on a circle of `n` pebbles. It jumps clockwise by exactly `k` pebbles.  
The frog‚Äôs food (a worm) lies exactly 1 pebble ahead.  
Can the frog reach the worm, and if so, how many jumps are needed?

---

### (a) When can't the frog reach the worm?

The frog visits positions:

```
0, k, 2k, 3k, ..., mod n
```

To reach the worm:
```
k * m ‚â° 1 mod n
```

This has a solution **iff** `gcd(k, n) = 1`.  
So if `gcd(k, n) ‚â† 1`, the frog can **never** reach the worm.

**Example:**  
If `k = 3`, `n = 6`: the frog will just visit `0, 3, 0, 3, ...`, never reaching 1.

---

### (b) When the frog can reach the worm ‚Äî use Pulverizer

We want:
```
k * m ‚â° 1 mod n
```
This is solved using the **Extended Euclidean Algorithm** (a.k.a. the Pulverizer),  
which finds integers `x`, `y` such that:
```
k * x + n * y = 1
‚áí x ‚â° k‚Åª¬π mod n
```
Then `x` is the number of jumps.

---

### (c) Compute for `n = 50`, `k = 21`

Use Pulverizer:

```
1 = 8 * 50 - 19 * 21
‚áí 21 * (-19) ‚â° 1 mod 50
‚áí j = -19 ‚â° 31 mod 50
```

‚úÖ **Minimum number of jumps: 31**

But note:

```
21 * 19 ‚â° -1 mod 50
‚áí 21 * 931 = 21 * (19 * 49) ‚â° 1 mod 50
```

So 931 is **also** a correct answer ‚Äî but it's 49 cycles of 19 jumps, and inefficient.

## üîπ Problem 2: Fibonacci Coprimality

### üß© Statement

Prove by induction that for all `n ‚â• 0`, the Fibonacci numbers `F‚Çô` and `F‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ` are relatively prime:

```
gcd(F‚Çô, F‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ) = 1
```

Where:
- `F‚ÇÄ = 0`
- `F‚ÇÅ = 1`
- `F‚Çô = F‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ + F‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÇ` for `n ‚â• 2`

---

### ‚úÖ Inductive Proof

Let `P(n): gcd(F‚Çô, F‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ) = 1`.

**Base case:**  
`F‚ÇÄ = 0`, `F‚ÇÅ = 1` ‚Üí `gcd(0, 1) = 1` ‚úî

**Inductive step:**  
Assume `gcd(F‚Çô, F‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ) = 1`.  
We want to prove `gcd(F‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ, F‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÇ) = 1`.

Since:
```
F‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÇ = F‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ + F‚Çô
```

Suppose `d` divides both `F‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ` and `F‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÇ`. Then it must also divide:
```
F‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÇ - F‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ = F‚Çô
```

‚áí `d` divides both `F‚Çô` and `F‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ`, contradicting the inductive hypothesis.  
Thus, `gcd(F‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ, F‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÇ) = 1`, and `P(n+1)` holds.

‚úÖ By induction, `F‚Çô` and `F‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ` are relatively prime ‚àÄ n ‚â• 0.

## üîπ Problem 3: The Power of 3

### üß© Statement

Let `N` be a number with `3‚Åø` identical digits (e.g., 777...777 with `3‚Åø` digits).  
Prove by induction that `3‚Åø` divides `N`.

Example:  
```
3¬≤ = 9  
N = 777777777 ‚Üí 9 digits  
‚áí 9 | N
```

---

### ‚úÖ Key Idea

Recall: A number is divisible by 3 **iff** its digit sum is divisible by 3.  
If `N` is made of `3‚Åø` copies of digit `d`, then:

```
Sum of digits = d * 3‚Åø
‚áí 3‚Åø | sum ‚áí 3‚Åø | N
```

---

### ‚úÖ Inductive Proof

Let `P(n): 3‚Åø divides the number made of 3‚Åø identical digits d`.

**Base case (n = 0):**  
`3‚Å∞ = 1`, and any digit is divisible by 1 ‚úî

**Inductive step:**  
Assume `P(k)` holds: 3·µè divides a number `N‚Çñ` of `3·µè` identical digits.

Then construct `N‚Çñ‚Çä‚ÇÅ` by repeating `N‚Çñ` three times ‚Üí has `3^{k+1}` digits.  
Its digit sum is:
```
3 √ó (d √ó 3·µè) = d √ó 3^{k+1}
‚áí divisible by 3^{k+1}
```

‚úÖ Therefore, `P(k+1)` holds.

## ‚úÖ Final Notes

These problems combine:
- **Modular arithmetic**
- **Greatest common divisors**
- **Modular inverses**
- **Proof by induction**
- **Digit-sum divisibility tests**

They form the foundation for number theory and computational mathematics.
